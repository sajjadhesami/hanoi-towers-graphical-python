# hanoi-towers-graphical-python
This is an implementation of the Hanoi Towers problem with a graphical representation of the steps in Python. To read more about the problem itself, take a look at its Wikipedia page ([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)).

The implementation uses "color.py" and "stddraw.py" from [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/).

The script receives a numerical input in system arguments defining the number of discs. The size of the canvas and discs should be edited manually from within the code if it was necessary.
Overall, the size of the canvas is big enough for 10 discs.
